        <h1>Cookie Man</h1>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a land near and far,
            There was a man, walking down the street, like a star.
            He was talking and humming, a happy tune,
            But then, all of a sudden, his body and head turned into a giant chocolate chip cookie, like a big balloon.</p>
            <p>He looked down at himself and began to shout,
            "Oh my goodness, what is this all about?"
            He looked like a cookie, big and round,
            He couldn't believe what had just astounded.</p>
            
            <p>He tried to walk but stumbled and fell,
            He was a cookie, how could he tell?
            He tried to talk, but all that came out,
            Were crumbs and chocolate chips, without a doubt.</p>
            
            <p>He was confused, and quite scared,
            He didn't know how to get himself repaired.
            He walked down the street, as cookies do,
            But people were staring, they hadn't a clue.</p>
            
            <p>He tried to explain, but they couldn't understand,
            All they saw was a cookie, in the shape of a man.
            He was sad and alone, in his cookie form,
            He missed his old body, and wished to be reborn.</p>

            <p>But then, a kind witch, took pity on him,
            She said, "I'll help you, don't be grim."
            With a wave of her wand, and a magical spell,
            He was back to his old self, and all was well.</p>
            
            <p>
            He thanked the witch, and went on his way,
            But he never forgot, his cookie day.
            He learned a valuable lesson, that's for sure,
            Be careful what you wish for, or you may turn into something obscure.</p>
